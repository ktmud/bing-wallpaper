Bing Wallpaper for Mac and Ubuntu
=================================

Information
-----------
A script which downloads the latest picture of the day from Bing.com and saves
it to a directory.

The script was tested on:
    Mac OS X 10.8.2 and 10.8.3
    Ubuntu 12.04 - 13.10

[Blog entry](http://blog.ideasftw.com/2012/12/bing-desktop-for-mac.html)

How to use?
-----------
* Just run the **bing-wallpaper.sh** script from the terminal. The script will
download the bing image.
* If desired, change the default **PICTURE_DIR** in **bing-wallpaper.sh** to the
wallpaper directory. If left unchanged the default value is
**~/Pictures/bing-wallpapers/**.

Configuration on Mac
--------------------
* Open Mac's `System Preferences` -> `Desktop & Screensaver`, add the wallpaper
directory, and configure to taste.

* To have the script run everyday automatically you will need to setup launchd
(Mac only, for Ubuntu see below). I have provided a sample plist file, found in
the Tools directory, which can be copied to **$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents** and
loaded with the command
  `launchctl load $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ideasftw.bing-wallpaper.plist`
Modify the plist as needed to point to **bing-wallpaper.sh**. For more
information on configuring launchd [see here](
http://blog.ideasftw.com/2013/02/run-script-from-launchd-instead-of-cron.html).

* Another option on Mac (and arguably a little simpler) is to set the Calendar
app to run the **Tools/Bing Wallpaper.app** [at a recurring daily time](
http://blog.ideasftw.com/2013/03/use-mac-calendar-and-automator-to-run.html).
Modify the app (from within Automator) as it needs to point to
**bing-wallpaper.sh** and the correct **PICTURE_DIR**.

Configuration on Ubuntu
-----------------------
**TL;DR:**

* To install Gnome background slideshow, in the terminal run:

  $ git clone git@github.com:thejandroman/bing-wallpaper.git
  $ bing-wallpaper/Tools/gnome-bing-slideshow/deploy-gnome-settings.sh

* Register `bing-wallpaper/bing-random-pic.sh` to run regularly.

* Change the background properties to use the new slideshow.

**How to register bing-wallpaper.sh or bing-random-pic.sh to run regularly.**

There are two ways to run the scipts regularly: cron jobs and startup
applications.
* Cron jobs:
  * Change the path of **bing-wallpaper.sh** in **Tools/bing-cron** to the
    desired script location. If left unchanged the default value is
    **~/Pictures/bing-wallpaper.sh**.
  * From the terminal run `crontab /path/to/bing-cron` to setup the cronjob.
* Startup programs:
  * From HUD, search for startup applications.
  * Add **bing-random-pic.sh** or **bing-wallpaper.sh**.

The Ubuntu script was tested in Ubuntu 12.04 - 13.10.
