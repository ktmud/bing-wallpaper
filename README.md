Bing Wallpaper for Mac
=====================

Microsoft has an offical [bing wallpaper theme](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/bing-dynamic-theme) for Windows 7.

And that's where this little script comes from.

How to use?
-----------

* change the cd path in the first line of **bing-wallpaper.sh** to where you want to save the wallpapers.
* change the path of **bing-wallpager.sh** in **bing-cron** to where you put this script exactly 
* run `crontab bing-cron` to setup the cronjob.
* in Mac's `system preference` -> `wallpapers and screensaver`, add your wallpaper directory and setup the auto changement.
